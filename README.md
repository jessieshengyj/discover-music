# Music Generator

### My CPSC 210 Personal Project

*Hello and welcome* to my application!

This application is a **music recommendation generator**, which will allow the user to **discover new songs** for 
their playlists. First, the application will prompt the user to answer a series of questions regarding their 
music preference, or the type of music they hope to find. Based on their response, the program will filter 
and generate a list of songs that match the given description. Then, the user will have the option to continue 
choosing a song from these recommendations, or restart the program. To keep track of the user’s chosen songs, 
the application will allow the user to add the selected song to a playlist which is accessible from the home page.

This application is directed for individuals who hope to find more songs that match their music taste, or 
discover new songs from certain genres and time periods. For many people, music is an important and inseparable part
of their everyday life. As someone who also enjoys listening to music on a daily basis, I believe an application 
similar to this could help people like me **broaden our music selection**. Therefore, creating such a program would 
be an interesting process for me •◡•
